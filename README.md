# Hangman - Game

# Introduction
Project milestone 3 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: Python Terminal.<br><brZ>
Hangman is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The main goal of the game is to guess letters in order to find the word that the computer randomly selects. This project was inspired by the pencil guessing game for two or more players. 
According to the site [Gambiter](http://gambiter.com/paper-pencil/Hangman_game.html), this game has been around since 1894 under the name "Birds, Beasts and Fishes".

## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an easy app for the users to play the game.
2. Build a game that is both enjoyable and challenging for the players.
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to understand the purpose of the App and start a new game.
2. Be able to follow the score, see the wrong and right letters appear once I take a turn, and see how many tries remain before the game is over.
3. Be able to watch my results and other players' results on the Leaderboard.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to play the game again with a different word as chosen by the computer.
2. Be challenged and try to improve on my previous scores. 
3. Compare my scores with other users on the Leaderboard.
   
## Design

#### Colours
* The colours in the game are supplied by the Python Colorama Model

### Flowcharts 
![Flowcharts](./assets/images/readme/hangman-flowcharts.jpg)<br>
I spent time planning and thinking about the logic and flow behind the game to ensure I had a general idea of how it could be built. I created flowcharts to assist me with the logical flow throughout the application. The charts were generated using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) Integration and are shown below.<br>

## Features

### Logo and Intro Message

![How to Play](./assets/images/readme/hangman-message-back.jpg)<br>
The player has 7 attempts to try to guess the right word by inputting letters or can try to input all the letters to correctly complete the full . The word is randomly chosen by the computer from a list.
* When the game starts the player can see how many letters are in the word [1] and the computer will ask the player to input a letter or a word [7].
* If the player guesses the right letter, they will see a message from the computer [8] the letter guessed displayed in the word length [3], the hangman stage will remain the same [2] and the score will increase by 25 points [5]
* If the player guesses a wrong letter, they will see a message from the computer [9] the letter guessed displayed in the wrong letters guesses [4], the hangman stage will turn to the next stage [2] and the number of attempts will decrease by 1 [6]
* When the player types an invalid input, they will see a message from the computer [10].
* If the user guesses the right word they will see the [Winner Feature](#Hangman-Stage-9---Win)

* 7 letters guessed wrong and the player will see the [Loser Feature](#Hangman-Stage-8---lose)

## Storage Data

I have used a Google sheet to save the player name, city, score and date.  This sheet is connected to the code through the Google Drive and Google Sheet API by the Google Cloud Platform. This method allows me to send and receive data as I had access to the Google Sheet API credentials. I also added in the Config Vars to these credentials when I was deploying the project in Heroku. As this is sensitive data, I had to add the creds.json in the Git ignore file. This would ensure that these credentials are not pushed to the repository.

### Python Lines too Long
![Lines to long](./assets/images/readme/hangman-issue.jpg)
![Lines to long](./assets/images/readme/hangman-issue-result.jpg)

* When I first built the ASCII art for the logo I got the warning "line too long (126 > 79 characters)" from PEP8.<br>

### Fixed Bug
![Fix Bug](./assets/images/readme/hangman-issue-fixed.jpg)
* I had to rebuild the logo using the program Patorjk (ASCII Art Generator) to avoid these issues.
